# Analysis of Vendor Pricing Dynamics in the Oil Market

## Overview

This project investigates the pricing strategies of two vendors, Galleria and TandT, focusing on the relationship between current prices, historical prices, vendor-specific characteristics, and temporal trends. A Bayesian linear regression model is employed to understand these dynamics, using a simulated dataset to replicate real-world vendor pricing behavior. The project also includes robust model validation, diagnostic checks, and an in-depth exploration of observational data methodologies.
